# Life-USTC js examples

## Introduction

This repo aims to provide additional functionality for the app `Life@USTC`, which is a cross-platform app designed for USTC students.

With simple modifications to js scripts, you could also use these scripts to build your own version of the app, for example, for your own school, or better satisfy your own needs.

And the best part is, you don't need to know anything about Android or iOS development, just a little bit of js and html knowledge would be enough(in some case, just changing some URLs would make it work just perfectly), and you don't need to care about distribution/UI components, just focus on the logic of your app.

## How to use

This document will show how the app `Life@USTC` would interact with the js scripts, lifecycles, and how return values should be so that the app can properly display & handle them.

API documentation can be found [here](./docs/v1/README.md)

You would also find a useful nodejs setup in this repo, for you to test on your computer before testing on your phone.

After all these processes, you could distribute your version of the runtime with a simple URL, documented [here](./docs/Distribution.md)

## How to contribute

If you got any ideas on new features that requires new logic, bring it up here! Write a proper issue with models and examples backing your ideas, we would love community contributions on that matter

If you find a bug, please DO NOTICE that this repo only provides guidelines on how APIs shall be implemented, and does not provide any implementation of the app itself, so if you find a bug, please report it to the app developer, and if you find a bug in the API, please report it here, and we would fix it ASAP.
